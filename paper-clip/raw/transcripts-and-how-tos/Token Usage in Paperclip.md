## Introduction — 15 agents, cost is a real concern

Greetings everyone. Fruit here. I have

15 agents working 24/7 to optimize my

life and I make videos to show you how.

Now, Paperclip is a tool I talk quite a

bit about and if you've watched the

channel, you would understand how to get

Paperclip set up and to have your own

army of agents working for you 24/7.

Now, when you use paperclipip, uh cost

is a topic that comes up uh very

frequently. Um and it's one of those

things that paperclipip is a fun tool to

work with, but when the cost

conversation comes up, it stops being

fun and it could be very painful very

quickly. So, I want to spend some time

talking about some cost considerations

to be aware of when using paperclipip

and some settings you want to pay

attention to uh from a cost perspective.

Now coming in here in paper clip if if

you're not familiar with this so many

videos on the channel check them out. Uh

for cost in particular it really comes

## How models and tokens drive your Paperclip bill

down to the agent you're working with.

So if I have an agent every time that

agent runs it does use tokens. It does

use tokens and you have to provide it a

model to use. So if I come into my

configuration picking this particular

agent which is a business agent what I'm

going to do is scroll down and you can

see this adapter in here. So this

adapter tells the agent what model to

use in here. I am using the claw local.

What does that mean when I say using the

claw loc? Now I'm going to go back over

to the CLI. If you have claw, you

probably know what the claw CLI is. So

in here I'm in my claw CLI. I'm

authenticated. I have the max plan uh

for claw because I'm authenticated into

this with the max plan. It uses that

actually it says uh API usage billing

not I have the max plan and I switch

between accounts. So it it would use it

would use that uh billing if you have

the max subscription plan and you come

in here uh if you authenticated in there

you select the local adapter it would

## The credit limit problem — running out fast

simply pass through and use your

subscription plan. Now, if it's using

your subscription plan, one thing that

folks don't pay attention to is they

quickly run out of u out of their credit

limits for the week or for the day so

fast that um it becomes concerning. And

here's a couple of things you need to do

to address that. Number one is really

thinking about your heartbeat. So, if

you have an agent, so I have 15 agent.

Imagine if all these agents are running

every 2 minutes or every 5 minutes. That

is a lot. 15 * 5 it's it's it adds up

pretty quick. Now imagine if those

agents are all running every 5 minutes

using and I'll go back up here using

cloth and the model of choice is you

guessed it they are using oppus 4.6. So

15 agents running every 5 minutes using

oppus 4.6 you're going to get yourself

into trouble pretty quickly by burning

all your tokens. So that could be that

is definitely not something you want to

## Heartbeat cadence: the #1 cost lever

do. So how do you solve that? Number one

is think very clearly about your

heartbeat. So heartbeat is how often

this agent runs. So if you don't want it

running every day, don't put this to 5

seconds because if you put five here,

that's 5 seconds. If you put 60 here,

that's that's running um every minute.

So if you don't want that, if you don't

want it run every minute, make sure you

put a big enough number here. So if you

put 360 here, uh that is every hour.

uh this zero in front can seem to get

out. So, this is making this agent run

every hour. An agent that runs every

hour will cost you less than an agent

that runs every 5 minutes. I think

that's pretty self-evident.

Alternatively, an agent that doesn't run

at all, it will cost you way less than

an agent that's running every hour. So,

your your your cadence becomes

important. For some agents, you might

just want to keep them not to run and to

only run on a heartbeat or manual run.

## Not every agent needs to run daily — match cadence to purpose

So you come in here, you you hit manual

run, that's the only time you want your

agent. So if I think about estate, maybe

you do your estate planning once a year

or once every 6 months. Is there a

reason for this agent to run every day

or every week? Probably not. At that

point, you want to figure out what's the

cadence for every 6 months and then set

it as such. Um maybe for your chief of

staff that needs to run maybe daily and

send you a daily brief, then sure, set

it up to run every day. But making it

run every hour, is that really

necessary? Unless you have a I used to

have an agent called content agent and

that agent will would I think I called

it a scanner agent. It will run every

hour in my domain in my space. As you

can imagine, my my job here is to stay

on top of AI and and news and things

that are happening. It will essentially

scan the web for news and certain file

um um certain profiles and send me a

brief every hour. But that that was very

costly too. So I I kind of stopped that

uh and I went to a a morning brief and

an evening brief and that helped to

manage the cost. So two things number

one pick the right model and then number

## Skill files and agent instructions consume tokens too

two is set the right schedule that will

help significantly with uh cost. And

then number three to when the agents are

running, you want to think about your

skills. And this was wasn't very import

uh which is I tend to write I I use the

agents to write my skills files. And if

you're not sure with what the skill file

is or what the agent instruction file

is, again, I've made videos around this.

This is just the boss. It's just a lot

of text. I mean, you can tell that AI

wrote all of this because it did. AI did

actually write all of it. But the reason

why I'm saying that in tongue and cheek

here or or maybe not tongue and cheek is

because all of this is tokens. Every

time this agent runs, it packages all of

these instructions as tokens and sends

it to the model and you're paying for

those tokens in and you're paying for

those tokens out. So is there a way to

still convey your instructions without

having this just burn 5,000 tokens right

## Don't give agents skills they don't use

off the bat, right? How many however how

many words this is. So thinking about

your your agent instructions or your

skill instructions and how many skills

you give to an agent, are you going to

give the agent all skills? Even if the

agent doesn't use all the skills, those

are things you have to think think

about. So in this case, most of my

agents, I just need them to update my

calendar and maybe send me an email.

That's it. Give them those skills. uh

because this skill instructions at least

the definition of the skills uh goes

into the agent and that still consumes

some tokens or be so something to be to

be aware of. Now I think it's uh Peter

Derer or somebody that said to the

effect that Peter Dera is a good is a

was a manager like he was a a very good

author wrote a lot about management said

um you cannot manage what you don't

measure. So the reason why I'm saying

that is if you come in here and I've

talked about cost you might say but true

## Tokens in vs tokens out — what costs what

well that's interesting I see you've run

some models here but what does it what

did it cost you? Uh so pick on this

agent career agent and um

uh this agent is uh has run a couple of

times in this demo environment and you

can see the input tokens here not as

much output tokens quite a bit cash

tokens 6.2 2 million. That is a lot. But

the thing is cash tokens is is um

actually cheaper. It's about 10 times

cheaper for cash tokens. And and I can

talk about cash tokens in another uh

concept in in another video. But why is

it cost zero? Are you telling me that

this is costing zero? No, it's not. The

reason why it seems to cause zero is,

and I'm sure Paperclip will fix this, is

if you use the subscription, and I ran

all of these models on the subscription

on my Mac subscription, for some reason,

it doesn't, and I don't know what the

explanation is, but I think it doesn't

calculate the actual cost. But if if I

was logged in here with API, it will if

## Why Paperclip shows $0 with subscription billing

and I run I didn't haven't run this

today, but if I was running here with

API, it will um it will actually show

you the cost. And then at that time one

thing too I should I should go back is

let's go back to the agents. Let's go up

to the agents. Um you want to think

about the budget. So most of your agents

just talking about call set a budget.

Whenever the budget hits it will uh stop

this agent from working. But the budget

will not hit if we are dealing with a

situation where uh the cost is zero.

Right? How is the budget ever going to

hit $5 if the cost is always zero? So I

found a workound. I'm not show my walk

around, but I'm I'm really calling it a

walk around because I'll be surprised if

the paper clip folks don't fix this

pretty soon. Most people who use this

don't use the API. They use the

subscription and my big reason for using

paperclipip is because I could use my

subscription tokens. Not so with not so

much with open claw at least as far as I

know. So I'll go back over here. I'll

tell paperclipip

all right can you help me query

## The prompt to query Paperclip's embedded Postgres for real cost

paperclip's embedded posgress SQL

directly and uh you can use port 54 329

in particular and understand the usage

data on what is costing me uh to run

paper clip even if I'm using the the uh

entropic subscription as opposed to the

API base uh from from Antropic and then

apply anthropics AP PI pricing to the

token counts to show me what it's

costing me to run Paperclip using

Antropics uh subscription and then

always backfill the cost uh in sense on

paperclip so I can see on the UI in

paperclip how much each agent is is

costing me. Uh if you need to write code

to achieve that uh do it but I want to

see the results uh right now.

So that's the instruction I'm giving.

You can maybe pause uh pause the video,

take a screenshot of it and I'm hoping

that this instruction works because I

## How the usage-sync script works under the hood

tried it on my other environment and it

seems to work to show me the cost to a

certain extent. I'm hoping that with the

prompt in here I will um we will be able

to um to get it my the way it worked

when I did it was it actually wrote a

script that will query because paper

click behind the scenes is using

Postgress for actually running the

application. it wrote a a Python script

that will query that instance uh figure

out the tokens because I mean it's you

when you make those calls all of that is

stored in the database and then apply

the the

then it applied so it so it's seeing the

cost events database is looking at that

so I think this will work while this is

working

I want to go in and touch a little bit

about this tokens in so you can see

tokens in is pretty small and the reason

why this is small here is it's simply

for this particular agent it simply

wakes up and tell the agent to run and

## Reading a run: tokens in, tokens out, cached tokens explained

let me pick a particular run. Let me go

up here. I think this might be a good

one to talk about this particular topic.

So if I go in here and you look at this

particular run, you can see that when it

the token in is so small this is 5.4

5.4 for 54 tokens in that is tiny tokens

out is 4.8,000

is because token in is essentially just

triggering to say wake up agent run

right it wake up this career agent and

says go ahead and run. So the agent when

it's running it it kind of is doing a

lot of things. It's uh you can see it's

setting up the context pointing to a lot

of uh stuff setting up the environment

and then uh it goes into this really

verbose output that that comes back

authentication I think it ran into some

authentication issues in there. So all

of this I won't bel the point here with

## Cached tokens: 10x cheaper — what they are and how they build up

showcasing all of that but all of that

uh contributes to this output tokens.

Remember you're paying for tokens in and

you're paying for tokens out as far as

these models are concerned. You can look

at the pricing. Now, what is a cash

token? The cash token is as you as there

are several runs. Um,

there is a folder and I wouldn't show it

right here. CL has this concept of a

cache tokens where it saves the the the

things that is getting back. So, it's

not always hitting and at least that's

my understanding of it. It's not always

hitting the CL API every single time.

And that is considered cash tokens. And

those cash tokens builds up with more

runs you have. So, but you don't. Now, I

was very terrified when I saw this to

say, "Wow, means I'm paying for this

amount every single time." No, you're

not. You're kind of paying for it, but

you It's not at It's not at the same

cost as this. It's about 10 times. At

least that's what I heard or read that

it's about 10 times cheaper than the

most expensive is this and then this is

## Context management and when Claude clears the cache

not as expensive and then this is way

way cheap. So, but then it helps with

the context and managing the context

with longer conversations and then over

time CL clears up the cache tokens. You

can you can go delete it yourself in the

claw like there is a folder in there but

that's a little bit of an advanced

concept I don't want to be getting to

right now. All right. So, let's see.

It's um it's run and I told it to do it

right now. So, that's the cost. Let's go

back to UI with any log. So, if you

don't see the cost, a refresh.

Like I said, just take a Nope. It

doesn't show.

It doesn't show. Does the chief of staff

show anything?

All right. I'll say, "All right, I see

you show me the numbers here, but why is

it not showing on the actual paperclip

UI? I have refreshed the UI, but I don't

see anything."

All right. So, I'm asking, so in here,

## Live results: chief of staff $2, career $2.4, calendar $1.9

it's telling me the agent. And so chief

of staff is $2 based on the inferred

cost. Um

career is $2.4,

calendar agent is 1.9, and then I have

some agents. Wow, the Omega death. So I

have a couple of other companies in

there for demos.

Um so those are kind of costly.

But why I'm expecting now cuz what I'm

expecting is to see the cost showing up

in here. Um, so that should take a

second.

Yeah, I really wish I didn't have to do

this uh to get the cost. Okay, what else

uh to touch on from a cost perspective?

Oh, the the last piece, and I really had

this in my notes. Uh I would have been

uh disappointed if I didn't touch on

this, is when you set up your agents

from a cost perspective, because this

video is about cost.

Not every agent needs to run on cloth

## Choosing the right model per agent — not everything needs Sonnet

set 4.6 or OPOS 4.6. Not every agent

needs to run on that. As a matter of

fact, not every agent needs to run with

cloth. So this is where you can have and

I actually have a setup where I have um

some local models running and I could

give them like a very basic and I don't

have my Olama on this particular

machine. I can give them like a basic

model like Q you know 8 billion

parameter for like the web search model

and then uh because in that case you're

not paying and I have that running every

you know hour so I'm not worried about

paying for that and once it does his web

search it's writing that into a file and

then once a day my chief of staff when

it runs it's it reads that file and so

it's not spending time with the web

search and all of that is just

summarizing that and making it more

intelligent for me to consume and then

integrating that into my entire uh

system. So that is one way. So from a

cost perspective, I think we've talked

about your the model you choose, right?

## Using local Ollama models for cheap, frequent scans

The type of model you choose, the

cadence of running the models, managing

your tokens or or managing your your

your context. So tokens in, tokens out,

uh that goes into how you structure your

instructions. uh those factors all all

come in putting budgets uh so that uh

when things go ary you don't run into

issues and I think we we finally seem to

be having uh some numbers show up here

which is good uh let's see it shows up

here let's go back does it show up on

the dashboard not yet so um but if if

you don't see numbers in here and you're

wondering why why don't you see numbers

like I said it's because if you run with

the subscription

then the numbers don't show and honestly

if this doesn't refresh at this point I

would just say keep prompting it should

work I I got it working in another in

## Why subscription users see $0 — and what to do about it

another session I was really hoping to

see the total cost here but somehow it's

not showing

uh but I see it in here so it's showing

in here observe budget

um

So, I would just keep prompting and this

is what I tend to use paper clip with

cloth quite a bit. As you can tell, I

was just prompting here to say, "Hey,

I'm not seeing it. Can you go fix it?"

And eventually, it will fix it. But I

thought I'll show that to you guys. So,

um hopefully cost is not your concern. I

think somebody in the comment section

below today uh asked that question on

they use paperclip and it just blew away

their weekly limit. Well, hopefully this

gives you some levers. There are many

levers you can use on this. Hopefully,

this gives you some options to uh

consider and uh use to help with that.

And um yeah, as always, I'm uh

definitely reading the comments. If

there's any topic I should make um make

some videos about, let me know and I'll

see what I can do. If you haven't gotten

## Summary: model, cadence, instructions, budgets, measurement

the vault, you can grab the vault. It's

a startup pack. Use it as a startup.

There are about

200 prompts in there to give you some

ideas and and how to ask questions

against your data. Um, and even if it's

not relevant to you at this point, look

at it as a way to support the channel as

we're working and growing and building

AI to help you be AI ready. AI ready

you. Thank you for watching. As always,

this is F. I'll see you in the next

demo.
